#### Translation Scripts
    - To use the scripts you have to install [po4a] package from ubuntu or debian

    1. Edit the po-*.sh scripts replace LNG="de fr" with your languages
    2. Only when LNG= has changed you have to run po-create.sh
    3. Run po-translate.sh for translation on all languages in LNG=
    4. Run po-update.sh to update .po files for all languages

#### Tranlating .po files
    I use poedit for tranlations.
